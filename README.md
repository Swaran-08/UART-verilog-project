# UART-verilog-project
Implemented a complete UART transmitter–receiver system in Verilog HDL with baud rate generation, loopback integration, and simulation-based verification.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a complete UART communication system using Verilog HDL.  
It includes a UART transmitter, UART receiver, an internal baud rate generator,  
and a loopback integration to verify end-to-end data transfer.

## ⚙️ Key Highlights
- Verilog-based UART Transmitter and Receiver
- Internal baud clock generation
- Start bit and stop bit handling
- Loopback connection for self-testing
- Custom testbench for functional verification

## 🧪 Verification
The design is verified using simulation, where transmitted serial data is  
received back and displayed to confirm correct operation.
